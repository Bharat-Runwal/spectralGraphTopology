## Animal dataset

In this animal dataset (B. M. Lake an J. B. Tenenbaum 2010), there are 102 features which are
binary answers to questions such as "Does it has feathers?", "Is it warm-blooded?",
etc.  There are in total 33 animals to be clustered.


``` r
library(viridis)
library(spectralGraphTopology)
library(igraph)

# read data
df <- read.csv("animals.txt", header = FALSE)
names <- matrix(unlist(read.csv("animals_names.txt", header = FALSE)))
Y <- matrix(as.numeric(unlist(df)), nrow = nrow(df))
n <- nrow(Y)
# estimate graph
graph <- learn_k_component_graph(cov(t(Y)) + diag(1/3, n, n), w0 = "qp",
                                 beta = 1, k = 10, verbose = FALSE)
# build network
net <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(graph$adjacency, mode = "undirected", weighted = TRUE)
# colorify edges
colors <- viridis(50, begin = 0, end = 1, direction = -1)

E(net)$color = apply(c_scale(abs(E(net)$weight) / max(abs(E(net)$weight))), 1,
                     function(x) rgb(x[1]/255, x[2]/255, x[3]/255))
V(net)$color = "pink"
# plot network

     vertex.size = 4,
     vertex.label.dist = 1,
     vertex.label.family = "Helvetica",
     vertex.label.cex = .8,
